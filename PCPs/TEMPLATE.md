This is the suggested template for new PCPs.

## Abstract

A concise (~200 word) description of the PCP being proposed
This should be a very clear and human-readable version of the specification section.
Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this PCP is about.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for PCPs that want to change the functionality of the PLAYA3ULL GAMES Ecosystem.
It should clearly explain why the existing PLAYA3ULL GAMES Ecosystem implementation is inadequate to address the problem that the PCP solves.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any PCP.
The specification should be detailed enough to allow PLAYA3ULL GAMES to implement the PCP without consultation from the author(s).

## Backwards Compatibility

All PCPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.
The PCP should provide recommendations for dealing with these incompatibilities.

## Reference Implementation

A reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.
If the implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `./PCP-####-implementation/*` or linking to a PR on an external repository.

## Security Considerations

_Optional_ section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change.

## Open Questions

_Optional_ section that lists any concerns that should be resolved prior to implementation.
